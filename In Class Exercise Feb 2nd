1. Summarize the salaries data using summary(). Then use describe from the psych package. Compare the two methods.

summary(Salaries)
describe(Salaries)


2. What are the counts of men and women by rank? Also, compute the proportions of the total number; 
column proportions; row proportions.

salaries_table <- table(Salaries$sex, Salaries$rank)
prop.table(salaries_table)
prop.table(salaries_table, 1)
prop.table(salaries_table, 2)


3. Draw a histogram for years of service.  Add a density line in red. 

hist(Salaries$yrs.service, prob = TRUE, col="grey")# prob=TRUE for probabilities not counts
lines(density(Salaries$yrs.service),col="red",lwd=2)# add a density estimate with defaults


4. Draw a box plot for salary.

boxplot(Salaries$salary)


5. Draw a box plot for salary by rank. Make it horizontal.

boxplot(Salaries$salary ~ Salaries$rank, horizontal = TRUE)


6. Create a QQ plot of salary. What does the QQ plot tell you?

qqnorm(Salaries$salary)
It is used to find the normality of a variable
